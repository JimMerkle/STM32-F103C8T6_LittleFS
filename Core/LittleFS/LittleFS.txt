This is version 2.5 of LittleFS, April 14, 2022.

This module is a library that requires an interface to the user's Flash, as well as a configuration
data structure describing the FLASH, and the methods to call for access.

From that point, the functions defined in lfs.h may be used to mount, format, and use the file system.
